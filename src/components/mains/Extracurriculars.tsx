        <p>For upwards of 5 years, I competed in the First Tech Challenge robotics competitions, working with teammates to design, build, and program autonomous robots to execute multiâ€‘step objectives in competitive events. Along with that, I currently compete in Overwatch Esports at the collegiate level, where my team and I work together in a fast-paced environment to compete for Boston University in an objective-based first-person competition.</p>
